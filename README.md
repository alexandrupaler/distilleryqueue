The small scripts take CSV files generated by SurfBraid, and analyse them to determine optimal sizes for buffers holding distilled states.

The CSV files are of the form step,#A,Look#A, where:

* step - discrete time coordinate during circuit execution
* \#A - number of distilled states in the buffer
* Look\#A - lookahead of how many T gates will be executed in the future (this column is not used)

Buffer size and Lookahead values are set in SurfBraid.
