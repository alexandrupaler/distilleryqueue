# Empirical support for optimal T gate scheduling: Modelling distilleries as queues

The small scripts take CSV files generated by SurfBraid, and analyse them to determine optimal sizes for buffers holding distilled states.

The CSV files are of the form step,#A,Look#A, where:

* step - discrete time coordinate during circuit execution
* \#A - number of distilled states in the buffer
* Look\#A - lookahead of how many T gates will be executed in the future (this column is not used)

Buffer size and Lookahead values are set in SurfBraid.
